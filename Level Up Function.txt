//This one displays one of several quotes when a player levels up on top of their head.

//I removed the quotes but you can use your own, I have around 30 on my server. (Just replace Quote 1-3 and add as many as you'd like)

//It also gives the player 30 seconds of level 10 INC agi, and if the player is 150 or higher, 3 minutes of Bubble Gum effect.
